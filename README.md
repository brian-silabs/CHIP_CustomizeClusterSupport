# CHIP_CustomizeClusterSupport
This repository aims to explain how to custmoize your CHIP sample application Cluster Configuration 
This is going to make use of ZAP Generator and connectedhomeip repo

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

You can find a fork that has a branch bringing Window Covering Client Commands support to CHIP Tool [here](https://github.com/brian-silabs/connectedhomeip)

It is assumed that you already have checked out the connectedhomeip repo on your computer

## Note ##
At the time of writing, the ZAP tool using the connectedhomeip templates for source controller *DO NOT WORK* with Client Custers only
It is mandatory to add the Serverside of the clusterto get a working generation (will submit a PR later)
